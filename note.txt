.eq(): This method reduces the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. For example:
// Select the second element in the list
$("li").eq(1).css("color", "red");


.find(): This method gets the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. For example:
// Find all <span> elements within <div> elements
$("div").find("span").css("color", "blue");


.index(): This method returns the index position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to its sibling elements. For example:
// Get the index of the selected <li> element within its siblings
var index = $("li").index();
console.log(index);

each() Method:The each() method is used to iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. It allows you to perform a specific action for each item in a collection of elements.
Example:
// Iterate over all paragraphs and set their text to "Hello"
$("p").each(function(index, element) {
    $(this).text("Hello");
});
In this example, the each() method is used to iterate over all <p> elements on the page and set their text content to "Hello".


keyup() Event:The keyup() method is not a standalone method; it's an event handler in jQuery that is used to bind a function to the "keyup" event. The "keyup" event is triggered when a key on the keyboard is released.
Example:
// Attach a keyup event handler to an input element
$("input").keyup(function() {
    console.log("Key released!");
});
